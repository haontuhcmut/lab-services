# **Backend Development & Computer Vision**

## Database & Authentication

* Designed an ERD in MySQL using ORM for structured data management.
  
* Implemented email confirmation for signup with URLSafeTimedSerializer.
  
* Developed JWT authentication with access and refresh tokens.
  
* Integrated Redis for token storage, ensuring session invalidation on logout.

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

* Encoded role-based payloads (admin, user, team) for JWT-based access control.

* Developed secure CRUD operations using SQLModel and SQLAlchemy.

## Computer Vision & Machine Learning

* Pretrained and evaluated YOLO models with Ultralytics for object detection.

* Designed and deployed a colony detection system for microbiology laboratories.

* Built and deployed Docker images and containers for scalable applications.

* Deployed APIs and applications on VPS, ensuring reliability and performance.
